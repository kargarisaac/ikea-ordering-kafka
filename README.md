# Event-Driven Apps Using Kafka and Python

In this project, we will design and implement an event-driven application using Kafka in Python. We take an example of furniture ordering from somewhere like Ikea in this post. 
This is just a simple design that we do and is not similar to what is happening in the real world at Ikea.

We do this on our local machine, but for production environments, you can transfer it to a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
